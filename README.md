# Image-processing #openCV
I had the privilege of collaborating with e-yantra on an innovative project that involved the development of a sophisticated bot with advanced real-time color detection and line-following capabilities. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies, we harnessed the power of Python, along with libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, and scikit-learn, to bring this vision to life. Through our collective efforts and expertise, we successfully executed the project, demonstrating the incredible potential of Python in the realms of robotics and computer vision. This project not only showcased the versatility of Python but also underscored its significance in pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved in these exciting fields.
